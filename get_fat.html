    <p>Diet? What is that? Not in my vocabulary…</p>
    <p>No, just kidding (unfortunately)</p>
    <p>But anyway, it’s not because you’re on diet that you can’t eat some fat food sometines… 
      <br>Nothing’s better than cheese, sauce and cream, even though we have to run two kilometers after we eat them (as if we were going to run hahaha).</p>
    <p>To be more clear, nothing is better than eating fat food when you feel sad, depressed, angry, or whatever.
      <br>I mean nothing is better than eating fat food, but it is even better in those situations.</p>
    <p>So for you, ladies and gentlemen, I have decided to share my worst but betst fat recipes, hopefully you’ll feel good after eating them (or even better than you were before).</p>
