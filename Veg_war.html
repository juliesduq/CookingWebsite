    <h1>Vegetable war (self-definition) : The war waged against vegetables by people who refuse to eat them.</h1>
    <p>I’ve met many people waging the vegetable war through my short life, and I’ve been a part of their clan for years myself. 
      <br> Now, over 20 years old, mature and responsible (and, above all, a bit overweight), I had to stop that war and to raise the white flag.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the grandpa whom I’m dating has decided not to stop the war. 
      <br>Ignoring my many grievances, grandpa is stubborn and won’t change his mind, so I’ll let you know how I am fighting against my enemy to turn him a betrayer despite himself.</p>
    <p>Anyway, all that to say that you’ll find in here some recipes based on vegetables, and some cooking tips to hide vegetables in your food for children, stubborn boyfriends, bad husband and whoever is combatting our dear vegetables.</p>
    <p>Let us be strong together !</p>

<!--CONCLUSION-->
  <div id="final">
    <p>Nota bene : some vegetables such as zucchini, pepper, sprout or cauliflower might not be present in many of my recipe, I don’t really get along with them.
