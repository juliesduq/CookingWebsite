Summer is here, or at least it is in France, and I don’t know where you are but here it is really hot!
Today, I’ve decided to give you a salad recipe, my favourite one. Fresh, healthy and tasty, what else would we need?

To make that salad you need :
– 2 Hard-boiled eggs
– 1 avocado
– Chicken breast slices
– 2 tomatoes
– About 50g of mozzarella
– Sesame seeds (optional)

The advantage of that salad is that it groups all your need in one meal : you get vegetables, proteins and a dairy product. You can eat a slice of bread with it and drink a 100% fruit juice to make your meal really healthy.

The recipe is pretty simple, just cut everything in pieces and mix them all. I personnally don’t use any dressing for that salad, it does taste good without it and doesn’t feel like “dry”.
